Semi-one-off scripts for evaluating model performance for various experiments.

Also includes run_tf_detector.py, which is the simplest demonstration of how to invoke a TFODAPI-trained detector.

For all detections downstream of our TF detector, bounding boxes are represented in normalized coordinates, as [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax], with the origin in the upper-left of the image.
